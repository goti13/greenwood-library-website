# greenwood-library-website

## Background Scenario

Letâ€™s assume you're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library." The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Your team decides to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.
You will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.

## Objectives

The Objective of this project is to practice cloning a repository and working with branches in Git.
   -  Gain experience in staging, committing, and pushing changes from both developers.
   -  Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts.
